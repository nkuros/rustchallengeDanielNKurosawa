## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
Due to lack of familiarity with Rust, I had to guess what frameworks and packages to use and their integrations.

## How long did you spend on this project?
8 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Could not store locations(city, country) > would store using postgres hstore type
Wasn't able to pass SSL certificates > Was only able to run db on a container and had to run application locally
Wasn't able to mock db access in order to write unit tests


## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Lack of unit testing
Application running locally
External Api call in code
## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
